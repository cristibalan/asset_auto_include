AssetAutoInclude
=====================

== Resources

  script/plugin install git://github.com/evilchelu/asset_auto_include.git
 
== Usage

Add the following to the head of your template file

  <%= asset_auto_include_tags :javascript %>
  <%= asset_auto_include_tags :stylesheet %>
 
Now each time the template is loaded asset files in the 
public/(javascripts|stylesheets)/ folder that correspond to the name of the
current controller or view will be auto loaded. For example:

  /public
    /javascripts
      /auto
        /accounts
          show.js

  /public
    /stylesheets
      /auto
        users.css
        /users
          edit.css

Assuming the above file structure loading each of the following urls would load:
 
 mydomain.com/accounts        # no js files loaded
 mydomain.com/accounts/show/1 # loads auto/accounts/show.js
 mydomain.com/users           # loads auto/users/users.css
 mydomain.com/users/1/edit    # loads auto/users/users.css
                                loads auto/users/edit.css

There's also support for sass files. When using :stylesheet, the sass directory 
is also checked, along with the stylesheets directory.

  /public
    /stylesheets
      /sass
        /auto
          /posts
            view.sass

Assuming the above file structure loading each of the following urls would load:

 mydomain.com/users/1           # loads auto/posts/view.css
